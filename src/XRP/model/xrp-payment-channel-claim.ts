   * @param amount (Optional) The amount of XRP, in drops, authorized by the Signature.

   *                This is the cumulative amount of XRP that can be dispensed by the channel, including XRP previously redeemed.

   *                  amount of the claim. Required unless the sender of the transaction is the source address of the channel.
   * @param publicKey (Optional) The public key used for the signature, as hexadecimal. This must match the PublicKey stored
