# Xpring Common Protocol Buffers

The Xpring Common Protocol Buffers Library provides common protocol buffer models and gRPC service definitions to all client side libraries in [Xpring SDK](https://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-sdk). This library is built to be consumed as a submodule to other libraries, rather than a standalone library.

Developers should use one of the language specific libraries for [Xpring SDK](https://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-sdk#client-side-libraries), rather than consuming this library directly.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! To get started with building this library and opening pull requests, please see [contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
